# Advance-Search-android-Java-code-
This searching works on multiple fields and also contains the sorting feature. I used the same json data fetched from the server. 

Curently serching works on PlateNumer and SSN fields. If you want to add more fields then use the same steps that I have used in method filter()
in VehicleAdapter class.
I used the sample Json Data.
There is also more fields I used eg: latitude,longitude etc. So these fileds are assocated with plateNumber and SSN. So there order is very important.
